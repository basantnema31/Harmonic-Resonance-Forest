# HRF Architecture: The Titan-26 Unified Manifold

This document provides a technical overview of the **Harmonic Resonance Fields (HRF)** system architecture, focusing on the **Titan-26** unified manifold(Current implementatiion includes 16 operational units).

## 1. Architectural Philosophy

HRF moves beyond traditional statistical machine learning by treating classification as a physical wave interference problem. The architecture is designed to be **physics-informed**, meaning it uses physical laws (like damping and resonance) to model data relationships.

The core of the system is the **Titan-26 Manifold**, a 26-dimensional integration of diverse physical and statistical topologies.

## Overview

HRF Titan-26 represents the 26-dimensional extension of the HRF architecture, combining:
- Classical ML ensembles
- Geometric/topological models
- Harmonic wave-based units
- Macro-physical modeling layers
- Advanced neural architectures

All components are dynamically orchestrated by the G.O.D. (General Omni Dimensional) Optimizer.
